Interaction of gSite with gPlatform should be done with token transfer. It is necessary to create a table in which there will be a relationship between gSite and token. Then this token is passed with all requests from gSite to gPlatform, on the gPlatform side it is checked whether the token is correct and valid or not, then whether this token has access to the requested functionality. 
If each user has its own access to the gPlatform functionality, then the delimitation of user rights will either be implemented through gSite or directly by gPlatform, but in this case it will be necessary to match the user with a token in the table or add a token field in the users table.
